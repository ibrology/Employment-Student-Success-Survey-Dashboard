# Employment-Student-Success-Survey-Dashboard

The dashboard displayed the results of the Employment Student Success Domains Survey conducted at the University of Utah. It highlighted important statistics regarding student employment experiences, such as off-campus jobs, participation in student organizations, challenges with retention, evaluation methods, and recognition. 

Furthermore, I included demographic information about the survey participants, covering aspects like language, gender, job position, religious beliefs, and sexual orientation, as well as data on students contemplating leaving their roles in Student Affairs. Collectively, these visuals depict the employment environment and the demographic variety among student employees.
